# Residual-Network
A pytorch implement of ResNet
-----
Both directories are using ResNet-20, training and testing on different datasets -- CIFAR10 and Fashion-MNIST.

I trained the network on CIFAR-10 for 10 epochs, and got a accuracy of 80% on the testing set.

The Fashion-MNIST training set was trained for only 3 epochs due to resource limit, and 93% accuracy on testing set was achieved.
